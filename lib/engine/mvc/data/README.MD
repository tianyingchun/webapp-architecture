## Now we don't use enyo  standard model.

because enyo model is more suitable for do model-view two binding implementations.

- maybe in some list components we can use enyo standard model provider auto sync data

- between controller and model or  view  and model

- current default model is custmoized pure model(enyo kind class), we can directly create instance 
- for these model, manuly manager these model instance cache.
